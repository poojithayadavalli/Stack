"""
Given a string of words separated by spaces. The task is to find the first maximum length even word from the string. Eg: “You are given an array of n numbers” The answer would be “an” and not “of” because “an” comes before “of”.

Examples:

Input:  "this is a test string"
Output:  string
Even length words are this, is, test, string. Even
maximum length word is string.

Input:  "geeksforgeeks is a platform for geeks"
Output:  platform
Only even length word is platform.
